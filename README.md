# SkillSync Project

## Project Overview
SkillSync is a Python-based Command-Line Interface (CLI) application for managing workshop bookings and one-on-one meetings. The system uses Firebase for authentication and database management and integrates the Google Calendar API for scheduling. It enables users to:

- Request meetings with mentors from a database.
- Schedule one-on-one sessions with peers.
- Ensure all bookings occur strictly during weekdays (Monday to Friday) between 07:00 and 17:00.
- The app will be strictly terminal-based and packaged for distribution using `pyinstaller`.

## Features

### 1. Authentication
**Purpose:** Secure user access.

**Implementation:** Use Firebase Authentication for login and sign-up functionality.

**Database Integration:**
- Store user details (e.g., name, email, role).
- Maintain user roles such as mentor or peer.

### 2. Booking System
**Mentor Sessions:**
- Fetch and display a list of available mentors.
- Request a meeting with selected mentors.

**Peer Sessions:**
- Search for peers by availability or expertise.
- Schedule one-on-one meetings.

### 3. Google Calendar Integration
**Purpose:** Ensure meeting schedules are visible and manageable.

**Features:**
- Create calendar events for confirmed bookings.
- Send invites to all participants automatically.
- Enforce meeting times strictly on weekdays between 07:00 and 17:00.

### 4. CLI Functionality
The application will be developed using the `click` library to ensure a user-friendly terminal interface. The following menu options will be available:

- **Login:** Authenticate the user.
- **View Workshops:** List upcoming workshops and mentors available for booking.
- **Request Meeting:** Request a mentor or peer session.
- **View Bookings:** Display a list of all confirmed bookings.
- **Cancel Booking:** Allow users to cancel an existing booking.

### 5. Database Structure
```
Users:
  user_id: { name, email, role (mentor/peer), expertise }

Meetings:
  meeting_id: { mentor_id, mentee_id/peer_id, time, status }

Workshop Requests:
  workshop_id: { requestor_id, topic, date_requested }
```

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Tools and Frameworks
- **Firebase:** For authentication and database.
- **Google Calendar API:** For scheduling meetings.
- **Python Libraries:**
  - `click`: CLI framework.
  - `firebase-admin`: Firebase integration.
  - `google-api-python-client`: Google Calendar integration.
  - `pyinstaller`: To package the app.

### 2. Meeting Time Constraints
- All meetings must occur strictly during weekdays (Monday to Friday) and between 07:00 and 17:00.
- Developers must decide how to enforce and represent this scheduling constraint within the database and codebase.

## Stretch Features
- **Notifications:** Email notifications for meeting confirmations and reminders (via `smtplib`).
- **Feedback System:** Allow users to rate and leave feedback for mentors and peers.
- **Search Filters:** Enable filtering mentors/peers by expertise or availability.

## Packaging and Distribution
Use `pyinstaller` to convert the Python application into an executable file for easy distribution.

## Next Steps
1. **Set up Firebase:** Configure authentication and database.
2. **Integrate Google Calendar API:** Enable event creation and participant management.
3. **Develop the CLI:** Create interactive terminal commands using `click`.
4. **Test and Package:** Validate features and package the app with `pyinstaller`.
